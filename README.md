# Numerical_Methods_in_Soft_Matter
Repository with the solutions of the exercises assigned in the Course "Numerical Methods in Soft Matter" held in the Physis of Data master at the University of Padova.


The main topics are:

- Monte Carlo Methods

- Simulations of 2D ising with Metropolis, Wolff and Multiple Markov Chains methods

- Gillespie algorithm applied to Lotka-Volterra and Brusselator models

- Molecular Dynamics

- Langevein Dynamics

- Reweighting techniques

- Cell lists

  

The proposed exercises are listed in the file "Exercises_NMSM_23-24.pdf"


The source codes for the solutions can be found in the "source_codes" zip


The report with the results is named "NMSM_zenari_marco.pdf"
